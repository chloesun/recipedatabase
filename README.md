Operating system :Mac OS
Browser: Google Chrome

In this assignment you are going to build a database-backed web app using Node.js, Express, Pug, and Mongo. Specifically, you will build an application that allows the creation, storage, and retrieval of recipe information using Pug templating for the front end and MongoDB for storage on the back end.

The components are:

Server: built with Express, generates an HTML view from a .pug template, responds to HTTP requests for data stored in a mongoDB instance.

Client: single page app with (provided) jQuery AJAX interactions.
